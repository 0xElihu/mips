## Specification
    
### Motivation
I am applying to be a Facilitator of GovAlpha due to my current position as Governance Facilitator. I wish to continue in this role and be paid by the Maker Protocol.
    
### Core Unit ID
GovAlpha (GOV-001)

### Facilitator Name and Information

**Name:** @LongForWisdom  
**Permissioned Address:** 0x66f40F044E0e2F77bB746e3275E82e88dCBA2D69  

Note that this permissioned address should not be used directly for budget implementations, but rather as a keyholder in a relevant multi-sig wallet that distributes the Core Unit Budget.

### Facilitator Commitment
- The Facilitator Commitment is a detailed description and plan of what the Facilitator plans to do in order to achieve success for the Core Unit. There is a lot of flexibility in what a Facilitator can write in their commitment, including organizational structure and theory, plans for the budget, hiring and infrastructure plans, etc.
- The Facilitator commitment should also contain targets and goals that can be observed by Governance, if appropriate. This helps Governance to see whether the Facilitator is living up to their expectations.
- A crucial part of the Facilitator Commitment are clear commitments to transparency. The Facilitator should commit to an effective plan that will allow Governance and other stakeholders, such as contributors contemplating doing work, to gain direct insight into what is being worked on and who are taking care of what responsibilities.
