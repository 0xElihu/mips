## Specification
    
### Motivation
I am proposing this Core Unit because MakerDAO requires a consistent and well-run governance process managed by elected facilitators in order to remain stable and secure as it grows.
    
### Core Unit Name
**Name:** GovAlpha
**ID:** GOV-001

### GovAlpha's Mandate

**1. Neutrality and Moderation**
- Facilitators within GovAlpha are required to remain neutral and objective on issues outside of the governance domain and focus on policy, procedure and facilitation.
- GovAlpha is responsible for ensuring the health and integrity of the communication channels that are used for communication within MakerDAO. These tasks include moderation duties, establishing processes and social norms, and defending the channels from trolling and Sybil attacks.
- GovAlpha should aim to foster a culture of openness, receptiveness and reasoned discussion within the community.

**2. Resilience, Redundancy, Openess**
- GovAlpha must aim to onboard and maintain at least three Core Unit Facilitators at all times while prioritising candidates from unrepresented geographic regions.
- GovAlpha is responsible for operating emergency voting processes to protect the Maker Protocol in the event of an emergency.
- GovAlpha must be accessible to Maker Governance on all commonly used communication channels within MakerDAO.

**3. Operating Governance Processes**
- GovAlpha is responsible for scheduling, running and moderating a weekly governance and risk meeting.
- GovAlpha is responsible for managing governance processes as directed by relevant Accepted MIPs or MIP sets. 
- GovAlpha is responsible for creating on-chain polls on the ‘official’ voting frontend as directed by governance processes defined in relevant Accepted MIPs or MIP sets.
- GovAlpha is responsible for the non-technical portion of executive proposal creation.

**4. Governance Efficiency**
- GovAlpha must ensure that appropriate consensus gathering methods take place once debate on an issue has come to a natural end.
- GovAlpha must look for opportunities to streamline governance processes without sacrificing governance integrity. 
- GovAlpha must work to maintain and encourage healthy debate among Governance.
- GovAlpha must ensure that the upcoming governance schedule is well communicated to all stakeholders in a timely manner.
- GovAlpha should aim to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes. 
- GovAlpha should ensure that new members of Maker Governance have access to the resources necessary to bring them up to speed on the Maker Protocol.

**5. Governance Cohesion**
- GovAlpha is responsble for determining and communicating clear lines of action in the event of ambiguity within governance processes.
- GovAlpha is responsible for raising governance issues to other Core Units, and ensuring appropriate follow up for Governance. 
- GovAlpha must encourage Maker Governance to come to consensus over the least objectionable option(s) rather than treating decision-making as a competition where a subset must end up disappointed in the outcome. 
- GovAlpha must encourage Maker Governance to come together on divisive topics and to prevent political polarisation and demagoguery. 

### Team Structure

GovAlpha will function as a two-level hierarchy, consisting of facilitators and contributors. The key difference between facilitators and contributors is that contributors are not required to manage GovAlpha's budget, and that they are not directly responsible to Maker Governance for fulfilling GovAlpha's mandate. 

This difference in accountability means that decision-making power must lie in the hands of the facilitators rather than the contributors, and is the reason for this explicit hierarchy. 

In practice it is expected that the facilitators and contributors within GovAlpha will be relatively tight-knit and will operate and communicate on an equal footing in most matters. The facilitators of GovAlpha will always consult and seek input from contributors when making decisions that concern the future of GovAlpha, including drafting budget proposals.

The facilitators of GovAlpha will endeavour to provide contributors with fair remuneration and the opportunity for as much responsibility as they wish to take on.

#### Facilitators 

 As mentioned in the mandate, GovAlpha will always aim to have at least three Facilitators, who should be considered equal in terms of budgetary control, powers, and authority. There are three main reasons why three facilitators are the target number.
1. **Redundancy** - With at least three facilitators the Core Unit can recover from any two facilitators leaving the Unit unexpectedly. This also facilitates time-off and more forgiving working practices.
2. **Measured Decision-Making** - Given that the Facilitators of GovAlpha will be required to determine lines of action in the face of ambiguity in governance processes, it is imperative that they are able to discuss the issues privately with others in the same position.
3. **Representation** - MakerDAO is aimed to be a global organization. As far as possible, participants within Maker Governance should feel represented within GovAlpha by a Facilitator from their area of the world.

GovAlpha's Facilitators are responsible for ensuring that GovAlpha fulfils its mandate.
