### Introduction
Gitcoin’s mission is to grow open source and help devs find new economic opportunities.

There are many ways to do this, and gitcoin offers a few different products to enable this:

- Virtual hackathons: Online & worldwide. Sponsors post prizes, and people compete to earn them by building stuff to the specifications.
- Grants: A better way to fund innovation in your ecosystem. Grantees can create a fundraising page for “the great work they’re already doing” in the space, then raise $$$ for that work.
- Ethical ads via CodeFund: An advertising network that respects your privacy. Codefund allows you to monetize your audience without selling them out.


### Community
- What has your organization contributed to the crypto community?

We have delivered almost $5mm worth of funding to OSS devs in the Ethereum community. https://gitcoin.co/results

- Successful products, services, tools, libraries, thought-leadership

I've also given talks at ETHDenver, ETHBerlin, Devcon, etc. https://owocki.com/public-speaking/

- How will the Maker Community benefit from your inclusion as a Light Feed?

We will be faithful & responsible stewards of the data passed into the MKR Oracle system.

Note that DAI/SAI are some of the most used tokens on the Gitcoin platform!  We have a rational economic incentive to keep the price data clean & good!  https://gitcoin.co/leaderboard/tokens?cadence=quarterly&keyword=all&product=all
