## Sentence Summary

The Emergency Response MIP outlines the processes of implementing changes to the protocol outside of standard governance cycles, but within the agreed MIPs framework.

## Paragraph Summary

The Emergency Response MIP aims to provide a general guide that can be applied to a wide range of emergency situations.  This MIP will differentiate between an emergency response and an urgent response, and provide processes which can be carried out in a consistent manner.

## Component Summary

**MIP24c1: Emergency Definitions**

Defines the terms "urgent" and "emergency" for purposes of an expedited governance change

**MIP24c2: Considerations of Expedited Protocol Changes**

Outlines the various considerations that should be made before enacting expedited changes.

**MIP24c3: Emergency Response Procedure**

A general procedure for managing emergency situations.

**MIP24c4: Urgent Response Procedure**

A general procedure for managing urgent situations.

**MIP24c5: Role of Governance Facilitators**

Outlines the tasks of the Governance Facilitators during emergency interventions.

## Motivation

The protocol has often required changes outside of the standard weekly and monthly governance cycles to help maintain the peg or to respond to changes in the ecosystem.  The goal of this MIP is to provide a consistent process to manage emergencies and urgent issues. 

## Specification / Proposal Details

**MIP24c1: Emergency Definitions**

The procedure for managing expedited changes to the protocol will depend on whether an event is classified as urgent or an emergency.

**Emergency Response:** Any situation that would require immediate intervention to prevent initiation of Emergency Shutdown, severe peg divergence, or harm to members of the ecosystem.

**Urgent Response:** Any situation where the system would benefit from an expedited governance process and following the standard governance cycles would yield an insufficient response.

---

**MIP24c2: Considerations of Expedited Protocol Changes**

There are several important factors to consider before expediting changes to the protocol.
- Potential for MKR holders to miss a poll or executive vote due to diverging from the standard governance cycles.
- Expedited governance may not allow for sufficient discussion, leading to a sub-optimal solution.
- Increased governance burden on community and increased workload for domain teams.
- Frequent emergency actions may demonstrate lack of control in the governance process.

---

**MIP24c3: Emergency Response Procedure**

The ability to declare an emergency will be reserved for Domain Teams and Core Personnel due to their proximity to, and knowledge of, the Maker ecosystem.  If a community member wishes to declare an emergency, they will follow the urgent response procedure outlined in MIP24c4.

**The emergency response process will be initiated as follows:**

- Declare an emergency in the public forum providing sufficient detail regarding the issue and why immediate action is required.  If time does not permit, a forum post will be created immediately after or in parallel to taking emergency action. Creating a signal request for community sentiment, feedback, or parameter changes is optional.
	- If a remedy is known and uncontentious the Governance Facilitators will coordinate with necessary domain teams to expedite an executive vote.
	- If a remedy is not known or is contentious the Governance Facilitators will coordinate an emergency governance call to discuss solutions and a plan for subsequent actions.

---

**MIP24c4: Urgent Response Procedure**
 
An urgent response may be requested by any community member if they believe the system would benefit from an expedited governance action.  The process will be initiated with a signal request in the public forum stating the need for expedited governance and include the following:

- Poll to gage community sentiment of whether urgent action is needed.
- Propose the action that should be expedited in sufficient detail.
	- If this requires a poll, the practical guide to the signaling process will be followed.
	- Changes to system parameters must reach a 50% majority.
	- Changes outside existing system parameters require a 66% majority.
- Governance Facilitators will be notified and oversee discussion.
- If the signal for an urgent response passes, Governance Facilitators will coordinate with necessary domain teams to expedite a confirmation poll for MKR holders or to advance an executive vote, at their discretion.
	
At any time during the urgent response procedure a Domain Team or Core Personnel may elevate the status to an emergency.  At this time, the procedure in MIP24c3 will be carried out.

**MIP24c5: Role of Governance Facilitators**

Governance Facilitators will oversee emergency processes to ensure they are carried out in a civil and consistent manner.  They will be responsible for confirming poll outcomes and identifying whether the community or external actors have attempted to abuse or game the emergency process, and may block a request for emergency action at their discretion.
