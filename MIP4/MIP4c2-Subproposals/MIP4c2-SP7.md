## Specification

### Motivation

This amendment MIP proposes a number of changes to MIP4.

The first being a component that allows MIP amendments to be able to use the Weekly Governance Cycle for the first 3 months after a MIP has passed. This grants new MIPs greater flexibility to be fixed early and fast, improving overall governance efficiency.

The second being a component that allows multiple MIP amendments in one proposal. This is to make it convenient to mass-amend MIP sets that often have dependencies on each other. The Amendments would be change-centric rather than MIP-centric.
